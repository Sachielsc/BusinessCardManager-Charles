                <h3>Meeting 13: Jun 17th</h3>
                <h4>Important concept about back-end programming:</h4>
                <dl>
                <dt>Apache:</dt>
                <dd>Apache is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules. Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their web server software. However, WordPress can run on other web server software as well.
                </dd>
                <dt>Node.js</dt>
                <dd>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.<br>
                Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.<br>
                Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library</dd>
                <dt>Express.js</dt>
                <dd>Express.js is a Node.js framework. It's the most popular framework as of now. Some say express.js is to Node.js what Ruby on Rails or Sinatra is to Ruby. Express 3.x is a light-weight web application framework to help organize your web application into an MVC architecture on the server side. You can use a variety of choices for your templating language (like EJS, Jade, and Dust.js).</dd>
                <dt>Maven</dt>
                <dd>Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.<br>
                Maven addresses two aspects of building software: first, it describes how software is built, and second, it describes its dependencies. Contrary to preceding tools like Apache Ant, it uses conventions for the build procedure, and only exceptions need to be written down. An XML file describes the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. <br>
                Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation.</dd>
                <dt>npm</dt>
                <dd>npm, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.</dd>
                <dt>Spring</dt>
                <dd>The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform.</dd>
                <dt>JPA</dt>
                <dd>The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database. JPA was defined as part of the EJB 3.0 specification as a replacement for the EJB 2 CMP Entity Beans specification. JPA is now considered the standard industry approach for Object to Relational Mapping (ORM) in the Java Industry.<br>
                JPA itself is just a specification, not a product; it cannot perform persistence or anything else by itself. JPA is just a set of interfaces, and requires an implementation. There are open-source and commercial JPA implementations to choose from and any Java EE 5 application server should provide support for its use. JPA also requires a database to persist to.</dd>
                <dt>REST</dt>
                <dd>REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. The idea is that, rather than using complex mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC or SOAP to connect between machines, simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.<br>
                In many ways, the World Wide Web itself, based on HTTP, can be viewed as a REST-based architecture.<br>
                RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.<br>
                REST is a lightweight alternative to mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and Web Services (SOAP, WSDL, et al.). Later, we will see how much more simple REST is.<br>
                Despite being simple, REST is fully-featured; there's basically nothing you can do in Web Services that can't be done with a RESTful architecture.</dd></dl>

                <h4>My note about CSS:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. <br>
                        There are four different position values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>static</li>
                            <li>relative</li>
                            <li>fixed</li>
                            <li>absolute</li>
                        </ul>

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use <code>top: 50% / left: 50%</code> in combination with <code>translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%)</code> to dynamically vertically/horizontally center the element.<br>
                        <pre><code>position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);</code></pre></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Draw the "menu icon" with CSS:<br><pre><code>span {
    height: 3px;
    background: #97ff77;
    font-size: 0;
    margin-top: -2px;
    transition: all 1s ease;
    user-select: none;
    width: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
    
    &amp;::before {
        background: #97ff77;                
        position: absolute;
        transform: translateY(-250%);
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%;
        content: '';
    }
    
    &amp;::after {
        background: #97ff77;                
        position: absolute;
        transform: translateY(250%);
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%;
        content: '';
    }
}</code></pre></li>
                    <li>What is the difference between <code>visibility:hidden</code> and <code>display:none</code>?<br>
                    <code>display:none</code> will not be available in the page and does not occupy any space.<br>
                    <code>visibility:hidden</code> hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout. visibility:hidden preserve the space, whereas display:none doesn't preserve the space.</li>
                </ol>
